The 'Platform' game object on EditorScene is a Level Editor tool that runs in Editor Mode. I will try to write a short guide.
- First you need to load one of the current levels from the 'Scenes' selectbox.
- You can see and select GameObject prefabs under the Prefabs folder in the selectbox named Object Group.
- You can add the selected object to the scene with the green Add button. Red delete will delete the last object added from the scene.
- The 1st and 2nd Checkpoint count textbox lists the checkpoint numbers of the selected and loaded scene and serves as an input to update it.![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47754244/231313352-68119d5b-b3ec-4b96-b0be-9275bfc4c248.JPG)

The template scene is the only scene in the build and the prepared levels are played through this scene.
